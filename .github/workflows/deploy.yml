name: Deprecated Deployment Workflow

# This workflow for GitHub Pages has been deprecated.
# Modern hosting platforms like Netlify or Vercel provide a more streamlined
# deployment experience for Vite + React applications.
#
# Please see the new DEPLOYMENT.md file for instructions on how to
# deploy this application in a few simple steps.

# The following 'on' and 'jobs' sections are added to make this a valid,
# but non-functional, workflow file. This prevents GitHub from reporting
# syntax errors. The workflow is set to only run on manual trigger
# ('workflow_dispatch') and does nothing.
